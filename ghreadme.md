## Hello. I'm Anselm SchÃ¼ler.

Here, you can find some of my work and some info about me.

I'm a student that lives in Berlin. I'm interested in mathematics and coding.

I mostly code in Haskell. I also know Python and some scripting languages (Fish scripts, Shell code, Powershell scripts).

### Solid Projects:

These are projects that I still work on, but they're in a usable state.

- [hextra](https://github.com/schuelermine/hextra): A suite of miscellaneous functions for Haskell.
- [shell-terminal-configs](https://github.com/schuelermine/shell-terminal-configs): Some nice-looking (in my opinion) shell configs. Currently for Fish and Powershell.
- [gaussian](https://github.com/schuelermine/hextra): A Haskell library for Gaussian integers. Currently is missing division functionality (should be possible, â„¤Â² is a euclidean domain).

### Web Presence & Contact

My website is at [www.anselmschueler.com](https://www.anselmschueler.com). The `www` is necessary.

I'm personally on...
- Twitter as [@pisquaredbyi](https://twitter.com/pisquaredbyi)
- Reddit as [u/numerousblocks](https://www.reddit.com/user/numerousblocks/)

I'm also on [StackExchange, and, by extension, StackOverflow](https://stackexchange.com/users/10918971/schuelermine?tab=accounts). You might need to scroll down to see the individual accounts (like StackOverflow).
My website also lists some more accounts that I set up to be more business-like. They don't have any content currently.

#### You can contact me per e-mail at [mail@anselmschueler.com](mailto:mail@anselmschueler.com).
#### For Git-specific feedback, use [git@anselmschueler.com](mailto:git@anselmschueler.com).
#### If I lose access to that domain and can't answer, try [anselmschueler@gmail.com](mailto:anselmschueler@gmail.com).

### Future Projects:

These are projects that aren't finished in the slightest and shouldn't be used by anyone (yet). They may contain stupid premises or show inept code.

- [kalk](https://github.com/schuelermine/kalk): I wanted to make a library that represents mathematical formulae and values abstractly (instead of approximating them with floating-point numbers). It currently can only represent them, and can't resolve them.

### (Hopefully) Finished Projects:

These are projects that I won't be working on and that are done and in acceptable quality (regardless of actual usefulness).

- [turing.hs](https://github.com/schuelermine/turing.hs): A turing machine written in Haskell. Not tested, but should work fine. This was a thing I did in a day for fun.

### Trivia

- I use VS Code for programming.
- My font of choice is Cascadia Code. It has ligatures, by the way.
- I'm not too familiar with the Git CLI, so I use GitHub Desktop.
- I'm male.

Thank you for reading my profile's README.
